You're missing one or both of the parameters.....

The remoteadminlist.com is a free to use tool for Squad and Post Scriptum that translates your google sheets into remote admin lists.
These can then be entered into your servers RemoteAdminListHost.cfg files.




****************************************UPDATED PLEASE READ****************************************

Following an update from Google the original endpoint used by this tool was retired.
https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1_6RcFNbPNaZ2jViKAV3dMfc-Jx7BqPS-uaawq7JEb4A/1/public/values?alt=json
The tool has been rewritten and that means some changes for the URL, Config Sheet, IDs or Permissions.

There are two endpoints you can use that have slightly different requirements:

***************************************************************************************************

1. Via the API - this method uses the original Google Sheet ID used all along. 

If you've used this all along then the only change you need to make now is in the Share permissions:
-In the top right in Google Sheets select Share
-At the bottom of the Share window under Get a Link select Change
-Set this option to 'Anyone on the Internet with this link can view'
-Two optional additional parameters have been provided for the sheet names (config = csheet / id = isheet)

***************************************************************************************************

2. Via the 'Published to the web' endpoints. - this method uses the orignal share permissions.

If you've used this for some time the only change you need to make is to the IDs (URL & Config Sheet)
-In the File menu select 'Publish to the Web'
-Ensure the Google Sheet is Published.
-In the Link provided select the ID between 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/' and '/pubhtml'
-For the ID sheet ensure you update the first column of the config sheet with the new ID

****************************************UPDATED PLEASE READ****************************************






The php script takes 2 GET parameters (referenced in the URL), config and id, referring to 2 Google Sheets. e.g.
http://remoteadminlist.com/remoteadmin.php?config=1_6RcFNbPNaZ2jViKAV3dMfc-Jx7BqPS-uaawq7JEb4A&id=1MUTPM3KIIVkHdkgbEwlTwxY7TMPidKZ66MsebjY-HSA
Contains 2 GET parameters
1. a Config parameter:
1_6RcFNbPNaZ2jViKAV3dMfc-Jx7BqPS-uaawq7JEb4A
2. and an ID parameter:
1MUTPM3KIIVkHdkgbEwlTwxY7TMPidKZ66MsebjY-HSA

Therefore you will need 2 corresponding Google Sheets:

1. The Config Sheet - This sheet holds the settings for the way the users defined in the ID Google Sheet will be mapped into roles in the RemoteAdminList.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_6RcFNbPNaZ2jViKAV3dMfc-Jx7BqPS-uaawq7JEb4A/edit#gid=0
It contains 4 columns:
-the reference of the ID spreadsheet these roles will be applied to
-the role group name
-the access permissions granted to the role group https://squad.gamepedia.com/Server_Administration
-a free text field to remind you what the sheet is (usually the title of the ID sheet)

2. The ID Sheet - This sheet contains a list of the users that will be mapped to the roles defined in the corresponding Config Google Sheet.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MUTPM3KIIVkHdkgbEwlTwxY7TMPidKZ66MsebjY-HSA/edit#gid=0
It also contains 4 columns:
-users clan
-users name
-users group (must be correspond to the group defined in the Config Google Sheet)
-users steam id (starting 7656...)

IMPORTANT
1. Once you have drafted these Google Sheets you need to publish them (Go to the 'File' menu and click on 'Publish to the Web').
If you do not then the permissions will restrict the php script being able to extract the information in your Google Sheets.
This does not affect edit rights which can be defined as per usual in Google Sheets. 
2. The reference of the ID sheet must be added to the Config Google Sheet next to the role groups created in relation to it.
You can have one master Config Google Sheet for multiple ID Google Sheets.

This is a great way to get users to add permissions for themselves for one off events (such as one life events)
as you can control what permissions they are allowed to assign themselves to. It's also a great way to provide whitelists
and admin permissions to partner and stakeholder clans in your servers so that they can add new members and remove old members
without asking the server owner every time.

It's free to use and there's a second version hosted at:
http://internetthingy.co.uk/remoteadmin.php
If you which to host a version yourself you can download it from GitHub.
